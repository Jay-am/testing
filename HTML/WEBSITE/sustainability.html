          <h3>MATERIALS</h3>
          <p>We are not touching new ressources. All our products are made of recycled (existing) organic materials or from regenerative resources (like plants) whose production actually strengthens soils, waterways, habitats, air quality, and local communities. Every single product can be recycled later on, so no materials and resources are wasted and ending up as litter or in oceans. The footprint can be reduced by xx%.</p>

          <h3>PRODUCTION</h3>
          <h4 class="ultra-strong">WORK FORCE</h4>
          <p>We believe that world-class manufacturing begins with the respect for people and our planet. Because sustainability is just as much about social standards as environmental issues, we are choosing suppliers who share our values and commitment. Working with factories that share the same values gives us the confidence that our production standards are fully met. We work with suppliers that respect and uphold the rights of employees and workers throughout the supply chain by ensuring they are treated fairly, provided with safe, healthy and respectful workplaces and guaranteed a minimum wage.</p>
          <h4 class="spacer | ultra-strong">ENERGY</h4>
          <p>All the energy fueling the manufacturing and distribution of the products is from renewable energy to minimize our footprint even more.</p>

          <h3>PACKAGING</h3>
          <p>We are striving for zero waste. We believe that every little detail counts and makes a big difference in the long term. Since our eco friendly gift wrappings are used to wrap other products, we decided against a separate packaging for them. This way we can make sure that no tree will die just to present our products more nicely and thus reduce our footprint by xx%.</p>

          <p>All webshop orders are send in sustainable shipping bags made from recycled materials and shipped environmentally friendly with DHL GoGreen. Within the parcel, we only include a packing slip (since we are forced to do so), whereas other documents/information are provided digitally to minimize paper usage. Additionally, our customers from the Netherlands can make use of our paperless return system.</p>

          <h4 class="ultra-strong">PRODUCT PRESENTATION</h4>
          <p>Good product images are one of the most important elements to avoid disappointment and returns and thus a lot of resources that are needed to deliver/return the products. Hence, we include high-resolution product shots with multiple angles / pictures. We also provide videos on how to use our products and display pictures on how to style your gifts for more inspiration.</p>
          <h4 class="spacer | ultra-strong">SIZE GUIDE</h4>
          <p>In hope to reduce orders with multiple sizes and returns based on wrong sizes (which will also result in extra packaging and shipping pollution) we provide sizing examples as well as a size guide.</p>
