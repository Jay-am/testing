        <!-- <p>Climate change, pollution, ocean and habitat destruction are looming and dire, and are the direct result of human actions.</p> -->
        <p>Today, even the most environmentally progressive businesses and citizens are primarily focused on reducing the negative, and not necessarily aiming for a positive or even reversed ecological impact.</p>
      <!-- </section>

      <section class="vision | content-spacer | panel" data-color="yellow-scroll"> -->
        <p>Our vision is to move towards a future where humans are a net positive, regenerative force for our planet. This vision can become a reality as more individuals, businesses, and communities move away from a disposable culture towards one in which people are making holistic, thoughtful decisions. Decisions that are rooted in respect for the natural resources and a new way of thinking about how products are created, used, and where they end up after their life cycle.</p>
      </section>
 
      <section class="purpose | container | content-spacer | panel" data-color="white-scroll">
        <h1 class="pd-left-right">Therefore our purpose is threefold</h1>
        <h2 class="purpose-1__headline">We are striving to be an ecologically ‘net positive’ company.</h2>
        <p class="purpose-1">We work towards a future in which our products, operations and supply chain are a positive, regenerative force for our planet. Where selling one of our products actually leads to carbon reduction and a stronger environment. We already pursue progressive strategies across all steps of the supply chain - sourcing, packaging, shipping, reverse logistics, and end-of-life (see more on that on our sustainability page) and are very proud of our current product line, made with 100% recycled materials, but we know there is much more to do. Achieving our goal will require new ways of thinking about production and delivery, incremental improvements in our operations, and major innovations in everything from raw materials to how we protect and package our bundles to the inks we are using.</p>

        <h2 class="purpose-2__headline">We aim to support and inspire everyone in adopting conscious, eco-minded practices so they can become a positive force for our planet and humanity.</h2>
        <p class="purpose-2">We provide the most thoughtfully selected, comprehensively researched, eco friendly gift wrappings available. We want to help everyone to wrap their presents in the most sustainable way so they are not only making one single person happy for a short period of time but are helping our planet and future generations to thrive and survive. Our objective is to raise awareness on waste reduction and sustainable resources because we urgently need to wake up and change the way we act. We want to help to conveniently make a positive impact through reducing, reusing as well as recycling and are helping to effortlessly recover what we have destroyed so far.</p>

        <h3 class="green | brand">REDUCE</h3>
        <p class="green">We are calling for reducing single use gift wrappings that are ending in landfills after making just one single presentee happy. Reduce waste by using products that are reusable or by upcycling other products - that would be thrown away otherwise - for that purpose. reduce waste (alredy existing newly produced)We also encourage upcycling products that have lost their shine or purpose and are presenting tips on how to do so in our block.</p>

        <h3 class="green | brand">REUSE</h3>
        <p class="green">We are providing eco friendly gift wrappings that happen to be not only beautiful but also easy to use and reuse endlessly. We are asking to reuse existing materials and thus effectively reducing the need for resources while lowering waste volumes and saving money. A huge percentage of resources are incorporated in the consumption of gift wrappings - the mixed materials that are used yet the end destination for most of them are landfills. Reusable products not only in the sense of reusing them during their life cycle but also later on. Giving them a new life in a different shape. We also encourage upcycling products that have lost their shine or purpose and are presenting tips on how to do so in our block.</p>

        <h3 class="green | brand">RECYCLE</h3>
        <p class="green">Using resources that have reached the end of their life cycle minimizes the need for new materials and lowers the amount that ends up in landfills. Thus, we are only using recycled materials to produce our COVERs. And in case your <span class="brand">COVER</span> has reached the end of its life cycle it can be recycled as well. We also encourage upcycling products that have lost their shine or purpose and are presenting tips on how to do so in our block.</p>

        <h3 class="red | brand">RECOVER</h3>
        <p class="red">Not using new natural resources is one thing to make a change but we also need to recover what we have destroyed so far. This is why we’re also planting a tree for every <span class="brand">COVER</span> bought. This tree will get your name and you can watch it in our app or even visit it - if you want to get a closer tie.</p>

        <h2 class="purpose-3__headline">Ultimately, our goal is to make forward thinking, eco-friendly and conscious living the standard in our society.</h2>
        <p class="purpose-3">We aim to inspire and support everyone in their quest to make a positive impact on the planet and their communities and show easy and convenient ways on how to do so in daily real life situations. This way of life leads to more mindful, appreciative people and connected communities. A culture rooted in conscious decision making will give way to improved creation and usage of raw materials, to balanced carbon emissions, to enriched lands, habitats and oceans, to groundbreaking eco-minded innovations, and, ultimately, to a world where climate change and pollution has truly been reversed.</p>
