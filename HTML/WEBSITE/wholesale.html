        <h2>ONE GIFT AT A TIME!</h2>

        <h3>WHY OUR PARTNERS CHOOSE TO WORK WITH US:</h3>
        <h3>BEING PART OF THE MOVEMENT (ENVIRONMENTALLY ENGAGED COMPANY)</h3>
        <p>

          that is changing the world for the better. A movement of equal minded
          who eagerly want to make a difference. A movement that is working

          result - against climate change.
        </p>

        <h3>PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIP</h3>
        <p>

          You order our products, display them in your store and communicate
          their huge impact on the environment. If they're getting bought you’re
          winning and in case you shouldn’t be able to sell them, you can just
          return them. Either situation’s a win scenario. No risk involved.

        <h3>HOW TO BECOME A RETAILER</h3>
        <h4>STEP 1: SEND YOUR INQUIRY</h4>
        <p>
          If you are a concept store, gift shop or any other store, we would
          love to get to know you! Please send a message to
          <span class="email">wholesale@cover.international</span>. We'd
          appreciate it, if you would shortly introduce yourself, describe what
          you do and share your vision of our future partnership.
        </p>

        <h4>STEP 2: GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER (INTEREXCHANGE)</h4>
        <p>
          We bet you have a lot of questions you would love to ask us as well.
          We will take all the time needed to really get to know each other so
          we can build a meaningful relationship. Weather on the phone, via
          video call or in person. We will discuss which amounts are perfect for
          the size of your store and finalize the details.
        </p>

        <h4>STEP 3: GETTING SERIOUS (ORDER + SHIPPING)</h4>
        <p>
          Are you ready for our common future? Now it’s time to commit. After
          you placed the order we will make sure that this is the beginning of a
          wonderful long lasting relationship.
        </p>

        <h4>STEP 4: YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT</h4>
        <p>
          As usual we will plant a tree for every purchase made to recover
          forests, even when this purchase is initiated by you. The more COVERs
          you are selling the more you’re helping to recover our planet. You can
          communicate this to your customers and we will make sure to put your
          company on our website and promote you as a trusted partner.
        </p>

        <p>
          Welcome to the community - we are looking forward to changing the
          world with you!
