          <h2>OUR PLANET MATTERS</h2>
          <p>If Earth’s history is squeezed into one year, modern human has existed for 37 minutes and used up a third of Earth’s natural resources in the last 0.2 seconds.</p>
          <p class="source | right"><a href="http://www.theworldcounts.com" class="source__link">Source: The World Counts</a></p>

        <div class="planet__content | content-spacer">
          <p class="planet__paragraph">We are turning the Earth's resources into waste faster and faster. By 2030, the demands from 5.6 billion consumers will be draining the Earth for resources so fast that we need two planets to support us. If everyone lived like western consumers, we would even need five.</p>
          <p class="planet__paragraph">Through our actions we are destroying habitats and endangering the lives of future generations in alarming speed. Globally, carbon dioxide emissions and temperatures continue to grow, which leads the ice in Antarctica and Greenland melting at record speed and sea levels are rising. We are approaching a critical tipping point after which global warming will be impossible to stop or reverse. Real change is needed - not just from politicians and businesses - but from every single one of us.</p>
          <p class="planet__paragraph">We want to help develop a deeper awareness about the consequences our lifestyle has on the environment and make some urgently needed changes possible in a very convenient way. Because conscious choices today matter more than ever before.</p>
          <p class="planet__paragraph | p-4 | dark | strong">If you are frustrated by these developments as well and are looking for a way to gorgeously wrap your gifts while not producing more trash, harming our planet or the ones you're making a present but don’t want to use a newspaper because your gift should look premium - this is the right place for you to be. We create a reusable, high quality gift wrap collection that is not only beautiful, but also fair and sustainable.</p>

        </header>
        <div class="paper__content | content-spacer">
          <p class="paper__paragraph">Worldwide the war on plastic thankfully has already begun and with the increasing awareness of the environmental impact of plastic packaging, the demand for sustainable packaging materials has also grown. A material that has come into mainstream attention is paper because it’s been said that paper is the way to a sustainable future. But it takes twice the energy to produce paper than to produce a plastic bag. Data further indicates that the production of 1 kilogram of paper contaminates nearly 20 gallons of water and emits 3.5 kilogram of CO2. And people forget that paper is usually a single-use item as well. Especially when it comes to gift wrapping or packaging in general.</p>
          <p class="paper__paragraph">Each year we throw out enough gift wrap to circle the globe nine times - almost 230,000 miles of wrapping paper. And as population levels steadily grow, the sheer volume of wrapping paper used each year is staggering.</p>
          <p class="paper__paragraph">Another huge problem of wrapping paper is that many kinds of gift wraps are actually made with shiny foil or are coated in plastic film, rendering it unfit for the recycling bin because then neither is recyclable. Furthermore wrapping paper needs sticky tape to hold it together which isn’t recyclable. Same goes for plastic ribbons and bows.</p>
          <p class="paper__paragraph | dark | strong">But the biggest problem is that producing paper means cutting down trees. This is why papermaking has a massive impact on the environment.</p>

          <p class="change__paragraph">The truth is that the key causes of climate change are very largely within our own control. It’s the things we do every day - the personal decisions we make about how we travel, about the holidays we take and the way we wrap our gifts.</p>
          <p class="change__paragraph">Change only happens when everyone is paying attention. We can buy certified wood products, go paperless whenever possible, limit our consumption of products that use palm oil and plant a tree when possible.</p>
          <p class="change__paragraph">And that’s what we are doing. For every product bought we will plant a tree. If you are joining our community we can start a real movement to preserve existing forest ecosystems and recover trees. </p>

          <p class="zero-waste__paragraph">They are designed to be easily used - over and over again - and therfore won’t add to the single-use waste caused by usual wrapping paper.
