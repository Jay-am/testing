        <div class="paper__content | content-spacer">
          <p class="paper__paragraph | fade-in">Worldwide the war on plastic thankfully has already begun and with the increasing awareness of the environmental impact of plastic packaging, the demand for sustainable packaging materials has also grown.</p>
          <p class="paper__paragraph | fade-in">A material that has come into mainstream attention is paper because it’s been said that paper is the way to a sustainable future. But it takes twice the energy to produce paper than to produce a plastic bag.</p>
          <p class="paper__paragraph | fade-in">Data further indicates that the production of 1 kilogram of paper contaminates nearly 20 gallons of water and emits 3.5 kilogram of CO2. And people forget that paper is usually a single-use item as well. Especially when it comes to gift wrapping or packaging in general.</p>
          <p class="paper__paragraph | fade-in">Each year we throw out enough gift wrap to circle the globe nine times &mdash; almost 230,000 miles of wrapping paper. And as population levels steadily grow, the sheer volume of wrapping paper used each year is staggering.</p>
          <p class="paper__paragraph | fade-in">Another huge problem of wrapping paper is that many kinds of gift wraps are actually made with shiny foil or are coated in plastic film, rendering it unfit for the recycling bin because then neither is recyclable. Furthermore wrapping paper needs sticky tape to hold it together which isn’t recyclable. Same goes for plastic ribbons and bows.</p>
          <p class="paper__paragraph | h2 | dark | strong | fade-in">But the biggest problem is that producing paper means cutting down trees.</p>
          <p class="paper__paragraph | h2 | dark | strong | fade-in">This is why papermaking has a massive impact on the environment.</p>

          <p class="deforestation__paragraph | fade-in">Since the start of agriculture we’ve cut down almost half the trees on earth. And it’s not stopping. Losses recently have been on the rise. We’re cutting down 15 billion trees a year &mdash; that’s almost 41 million a day, 1.7 million an hour, 29,000 a minute, and 500 trees a second what’s equivalent to the size of 27 soccer fields lost every minute or one lost every second.</p>
          <p class="deforestation__paragraph | fade-in">If nothing is done and current trends continue, over 80 percent of forests will be lost by 2030 and completely gone by 2100.</p>
          <p class="deforestation__paragraph | deforestation-why | h2 | red | fade-in">Why is it important to stop deforestation?</p>
          <p class="deforestation__paragraph | fade-in">Forests play a critical role in mitigating climate change because they act as a carbon sink, soaking up carbon dioxide that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and contribute to ongoing changes in global climate patterns. Especially big old trees disproportionately hold the above-ground carbon storage.</p>
          <p class="deforestation__paragraph | fade-in">Currently, it’s estimated that 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions are the result of deforestation.</p>
          <p class="deforestation__paragraph | dark | strong | fade-in">Tropical tree cover alone can provide 23 percent of the climate mitigation needed over the next decade to meet goals set in the Paris Agreement in 2015 and offset climate change.</p>
          <p class="deforestation__paragraph | dark | strong | fade-in">This is why protecting and restoring this vast carbon sink is essential for mitigating climate change and why we are trying to improve the health of forest ecosystems.</p>
