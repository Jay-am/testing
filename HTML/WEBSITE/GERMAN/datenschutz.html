          <h3>1. THE COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h3>
          <p>
            You will always be informed in connection with the collection of your
            personal data – either by submitting the personal data yourself or by
            accepting our cookies. The personal data may include your name, e&#8209;mail
            address, similar identification data, information about an online purchase
            and your navigation on the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            When submitting your data on our website, it will always be stated whether
            the submission is voluntary or necessary for completing the desired
            action, such as completing a transaction at our webshop.
          </p>
          <p><span class="dark">Your personal data is collected when:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>You make a purchase on the webshop</li>
            <li>You sign up for our newsletter</li>
            <li>You create a client account</li>
            <li>You participate in a competition</li>
            <li>You actively engage with the website in another way</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you use your e&#8209;mail address in more than one of the above cases, your
            personal data will only be collected and registered in one place. This way
            your information is already stored when you shop with us, and you will not
            receive the same marketing material more than once.

          <h3>3. TRANSFERRING DATA TO OTHER CONTROLLERS</h3>
          <p>
            In general, we do not transfer your personal data to third parties without
            your consent. However, information used for delivery of goods will be
            transferred to the shipping company we use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under specific circumstances and with reference to legislation, it might
            be necessary to transfer information to public authorities or the police.
            For example, information may be disclosed to the police in case of
            suspicion of credit card fraud.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of a re-organization, full or partial sale of the company, any
            disclosure in such connection will be in accordance with current
            legislation for the processing of personal data.

            Your personal data is disclosed to our partners who deliver services on
            behalf of us, for example in relation to sending out newsletters. These

          <p>
            As we use the services of the Canadian platform Shopify when you shop at
            our website, your personal data is transferred to Canada. As a Canadian
            organization, Shopify handles your personal data according to the Personal
            Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which means
            they handle your personal data according to the highest security
            standards. We also use the services of MailChimp, located in the USA. As
            an American organization, MailChimp handles your personal data according
            to the EU-U.S Privacy Shield Framework, which means they also handle your
            data according to the highest international standards. The Commission has
            decided that the level of protection is sufficient in both countries. You
            can read more about secure third countries
