        <h3>THE ART OF GIFT-GIVING</h3>
        <h4>What is Furoshiki?</h4>
        <p>
          Furoshiki (風呂敷) are a type of traditional Japanese wrapping cloth
          traditionally used to transport clothes, gifts, or other goods.
          Furoshiki are, however, commonly used to wrap and transport lunch
          boxes (bento) and often double as a table mat for the lunch. The term,
          which literally translates to “bath (furo) spread (shiki),” was first
          used in the Nara period (710–794) as a means to protect valuable
          goods. Furoshiki is a square piece of cloth or fabric used for gift
          wrapping, transporting items, fashion, and home decor. The word refers
          both to the craft and to the cloth itself, which usually has an
          elegant, decorative design. Furoshiki fabric is knotted to enclose the
          item, requiring no further string, ribbon or adhesive to hold the
          package together.
        </p>

        <h4>Why should I use fabric wrapping?</h4>
        <p>
          Every year hundreds of thousands of kilometers of gift wrapping ends
          up in landfill. But since the production of paper involves cutting
          down trees, the impact on the environment is immense. With our COVERs
          you can not only be sure that you will avoid producing further waste
          and cutting down trees for the gifts you’re giving but also reducing
          waste since we’re only using recycled materials to produce the COVERs
          and recovering forests by planting new trees for every purchase made.
        </p>

        <h4>I recycle my wrapping paper. Why should I switch?</h4>
        <p>
          Only very few wrapping paper can be recycled since small quantities of
          plastic, foil and glitter render the gift wrap unsuitable for
          recycling, alongside the sellotape or adhesive used to secure the
          wrapping. Aside from this the process of recycling paper that is
          suitable combined with the production and other associated costs are
          non-trivial. With COVER a single wrap can be reused many times.
        </p>

        <h3>DESIGNS</h3>
        <h4>Do you have holiday specific prints?</h4>
        <p>
          Of course we do. There are several holiday specific prints available
          in our online store. Feel free to have a look regularly, since there
          are new designs exposed every season.
        </p>

        <h4>Will the designs change?</h4>
        <p>Definitely. There will be new designs added every season.</p>

        <h3>PRODUCTION</h3>
        <h4>Where are the products made?</h4>
        <p>
          We found a small GOTS certified family business in India that is next
          to helping us produce gorgeous items with recycled resources, teaching
          us how to be in sync with nature while living an ayurvedic lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h4>What kind of material do you use?</h4>
        <p>
          One of our policies is zero waste. Therefore we are not touching any
          new resources. All of our COVERs are made of organic, recycled
          materials and are completely biodegradable. If you need to discard a
          COVER because it xx, it will decompose in 2 to 5 months. No waste, no
          worries!
        </p>

        <h3>CARE INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <h4>Are there specific care instructions?</h4>
        <p>
          Our COVERS are very easy to handle. If your COVER gets dirty, just
          wash it with like colors in cold water and hang to prevent shrinking.
          If your COVER becomes wrinkled, iron or steam it to make it look neat
          again. You can find detailed care instructions on the product itself
          or in the description next to the product in our online store.
        </p>

        <h3>PACKAGING</h3>
        <h4>Do you provide gift wrapping?</h4>
        <p>
          Since the COVERs are conceived to wrap gifts themselves we do not
          provide gift wrapping for our COVERs.
        </p>

        <h4>Do COVERs come in a box or a bag?</h4>
        <p>
          One of our policies is zero waste. Since we are trying to save waste
          wherever possible, we decided against a packaging for the COVERs.
        </p>

        <h3>PAYMENTS</h3>
        <h4>Which payment methods can I use?</h4>
        <p>
          We accept Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, Visa Electron, American Express,
          ApplePay and PayPal.
        </p>
