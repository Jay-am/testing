            <h2>THE ART OF GIFT-GIVING</h2>
          </header>
          <h3>What is Furoshiki?</h3>
          <p>
            Furoshiki (風呂敷) are a type of traditional Japanese wrapping cloth consuetudinarily used to transport clothes, gifts and even lunch boxes. If used for the later, they also functioned as a table mat for the lunch. The term, which literally translates to bath (furo) spread (shiki), was first used in the Nara period (710–794) as a means to protect valuable goods. The word refers both to the craft and to the cloth itself. Furoshiki fabrics are knotted to enclose the items, requiring no further string, ribbon or adhesive to hold the package together.
          </p>
          <p>Do you want to know more about the Art of Furoshiki? Please see our <a href="#" class="link">Blog Post</a>.</p>
    
          <h3>Why should I use fabric wrapping?</h3>
          <p>
            Every year hundreds of thousands of kilometers of gift wrapping ends up in
            landfill. But since the production of paper involves cutting down trees,
            the impact on the environment is immense. With our <span class="brand">COVERs</span> you can not only be sure that you will avoid producing further waste and cutting down trees for the gifts you’re giving but also reducing waste since we’re only using
            recycled materials to produce the <span class="brand">COVERs</span> and recovering forests by planting new trees for every purchase made.
          </p>
    
          <h3>I recycle my wrapping paper. Why should I switch?</h3>
          <p>
            Only very few wrapping paper can be recycled since small quantities of
            plastic, foil and glitter render the gift wrap unsuitable for recycling,
            alongside the sellotape or adhesive used to secure the wrapping. Aside
            from this the process of recycling paper that is suitable combined with
            the production and other associated costs are non-trivial. With <span class="brand">COVER</span> a single wrap can be reused many times.

          <p>
            We found a small GOTS certified family business in India that is next to

            resources. All of our <span class="brand">COVERs</span> are made of organic, recycled materials and are recyclable / biodegradable. If you need to discard a <span class="brand">COVER</span>, it will decompose in 2 to 5 months. No waste, no worries!

            with like colors in cold water and hang to prevent shrinking. If your

            on worldwide orders over 100 Euro. If your purchase is below 50 Euro (100
            Euro), shipping is at your own expense. Please find more information about
            shipping costs <a href="#" class="link">here</a>.
          </p>
    
          <h3>How long does shipping take?</h3>
          <p>
            We typically process orders within a business day of receiving them
            (excluding weekends and holidays). Orders made before 12.00 am (CET) are
            being shipped until 14.00 pm (CET) the same day. Orders arriving after
            12.00 am (CET) will get picked up by DHL the next day at 14.00 pm (CET).
            Order fulfillment within Germany typically takes 2 to 4 business days.
            Order fulfillment within the EU usually takes xx to xx business days.
            International orders are expected to arrive within xx to xx business days.
            During peak seasons like christmas longer delivery times can be expected.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Will there be customs charges added to my order?</h3>
          <p>
            We are shipping our products from Germany. For orders that are arriving
            from countries outside the EU, shipments may be subject to import fees and
            taxes (e.g. import tariff, value-added tax, customs handling fees) that
            are due on arrival and are not covered by the shipping costs charged in
            our online store. These fees will be collected by the post office or
            courier service provider in your country or region and are calculated on
            the value of the order. The actual value of the order will be reported on
            the customs documents.
          </p>
    
          <h3>How high will the customs charges be?</h3>
          <p>
            It's impossible for us to determine customs charges as they vary from
            country to country and state to state. If you need any detailed
            information about these charges, please contact your local customs office.
            If you tell them that you'll be receiving a shipment from Germany and the
            value of your purchase, they'll be able to calculate the exact fees.
