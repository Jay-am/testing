          Are you looking for a creative and sustainable way to wrap your
          presents while also standing out as an environmentally-conscious
          organization that is giving back to customers, business partners,
          nature and mankind?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then let us celebrate the ‘Art of Giving’ while not only making the
          presentee happy but also make the world and future generations a
          present of reducing, reusing and recycling waste and also recovering
          forests and thus working against climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the best thing? The reusable nature of the product provides a
          powerful advertising opportunity for your brand. Instead of spending
          money on paper gift wrapping that goes directly into a landfill, and
          being responsible for cutting down trees, you can now send your
          customers off with something that will be passed on again and again,
          putting even more eyes on your identity and brand.
        </p>
        <p>Let's enjoy giving even more!</p>

        <p>Please notice:</p>
        <p>
          The minimum order quantity for custom made COVERs is 100 pieces. You
          can roughly estimate a lead time of 30 to 60 days. This depends on how
          quickly we’re getting through the design process and where the order
          has to get shipped to.
        </p>

        <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
        <h4>STEP 1: SEND YOUR INQUIRY</h4>
        <p>
          Send us an inquiry to <span class="email"
            >custom@cover.international</span
          >
          with your desired quantity and personalization preferences (logo,
          colors, design). If you already have a design in mind feel free to
          include it in your email.
        </p>

        <h4>STEP 2: THE DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
        <p>
          Based on your preferences, we will create a custom preview of your
          customized COVER so you can see how the final product will look like.
          We are also happy to work with your agency to create your custom
          artwork. All we want is to create something that is unique for your
          business and communicates what matters to you.
        </p>

        <h4>STEP 3: FINALIZING THE DETAILS</h4>
        <p>
          Once you are satisfied with the design, we’ll send you a quote for
          approval and all the details to get the production started.
        </p>

        <h4>STEP 4: GETTING SERIOUS (PRODUCTION + SHIPPING)</h4>
        <p>
          After your approval we will launch the production process. As soon as
          the COVERS are ready to start their journey, we will send you a
          notification with all the details to track your order.
        </p>

        <h4>STEP 5: YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT (CERTIFICATE)</h4>
        <p>
          As usual we will plant trees for your purchase to recover forests. And
          as always they will get your name. As soon as these trees are planted
          you will receive a certificate with their location as well as a
          picture and the environmental impact these trees and purchased COVERs
          will have on our planet.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for making this planet a better place!</p>
