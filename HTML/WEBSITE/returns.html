        <h3>How to return items</h3>
        <h4>STEP 1: GET IN CONTACT</h4>
        <p>
          Please send a message to
          <span class="email">returns@cover.international</span> with your name
          and order number stating what you want to return.
        </p>
        <h4>STEP 2: RETURN YOUR ORDER</h4>
        <p>Please return your package to:</p>
        <address>COVER GmbH</address>
        <address>Logistic Center</address>
        <address>DÃ¼sseldorfer Str. 6-8</address>
        <address>68219 Mannheim</address>
        <address>Germany</address>
        <h4>STEP 3: GET A REFUND</h4>
        <p>
          Once we have received and accepted the returned item(s), you will
          receive a refund. Depending on the payment method and issuer, it may
          take a couple of hours up to a few days until the refund is credited
          to your account. Please note that from the day we have processed your
          return, it usually takes 1 to 3 business days before the amount is
          available on your account.
        </p>

        <h4>Please notice:</h4>
        <p>All items must be returned unused and in original packaging.</p>
        <p>
          The responsibility for the item(s) is yours until the item(s) has been
          delivered on the listed return address. For your own safety, please
          keep your postage receipt with tracking number until you have received
          your refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment, we do not offer exchanges. If you need a different size
          or color, please place a new order for the right one.
