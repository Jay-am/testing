            <li>PayPal</li>
            <li>ApplePay</li>

          <p>
            For your online safety, we require that you enter your CVV security code
            when paying with credit card on our website. The security code is an
            anti-fraud security feature to help verify that you are in position of
            your credit card. On most credit cards you will find the three-digit
            security code on the back of the card, usually on the right side. If you
            pay with American Express, the four-digit security code is found on the
            front of the card on the right side.

          <p>
            To maintain a high level of security when shopping with us, we have also
            implemented the PSD2 legislation (Revised Payment Service Directive) – a
            two-step verification method to avoid fraud.

            Once your goods leave our warehouse to be delivered, your payment will be

            you made a mistake while placing your order, please contact
            <span class="email">help@cover.international</span> as soon as possible.
            In rare cases, an ordered item can be out of stock. If this happens, you

            being liable for compensation or other costs, if your payment details are
            incorrect or cannot be verified, if we have reason to believe that your

              order number.
            </li>
            <li>
              STEP 2: Please return your package to

            <li>All items must be returned unused and in original packaging.</li>
            <li>
              STEP 3: Once we have received and accepted the returned item(s), you will
              receive a refund. Depending on the payment method and issuer, it may take
              a couple of hours up to a few days until the refund is credited to your
              account. Please note that from the day we have processed your return, it
              usually takes 1 to 3 business days before the amount is available on your
              account.
            </li>
            <li>
              The responsibility for the item(s) is yours until the item(s) has been
              delivered on the listed return address. For your own safety, please keep
              your postage receipt with tracking number until you have received your
              refund.

          <h4>The Right of Withdrawal</h4>
          <p>
            You have the right to regret your purchase and withdraw from it without
            giving any reason within 14 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            The withdrawal period will expire 14 days after the date on which you, or
            a third party acting on your behalf other than the courier, acquire
            physical possession of the goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you ordered multiple items, which were delivered separately, the
            withdrawal period will expire 14 days after the date on which you, or a
            third party acting on your behalf other than the courier, acquires
            physical possession of the last item.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case you ordered an item consisting of multiple lots or pieces, which
            were delivered separately, the withdrawal period will expire 14 days after
            the date on which you, or a third party acting on your behalf other than
            the courier, acquires physical possession of the last lot or piece.
          </p>
          <p>
            To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us at
            <span class="email">returns@cover.international</span> about your decision
            in an unequivocal statement. The withdrawal deadline is met if you send
            your notice before the withdrawal period of 14 days has expired.

            Today, cookies are used by almost all websites and are in many cases
            necessary to process, enhance and simplify a website visit – which is why
            we use them. For more information about our use of cookies, please read

            We strive to protect your information the best way possible, which is why
            we have implemented security measures to ensure that our internal

          <h3>12. OTHER MATTERS</h3>
          <h4>Updating our Website</h4>
          <p>
            We do our very best to update the website to ensure that prices, offers,
            descriptions, stock and other information concerning the goods are
            correct, but errors may occur. Although we aim for our website to be
            accurate in all aspects, we cannot guarantee that all products on the
            webshop are in stock once your order has been processed. In case of
            missing stock, pricing errors or other misleading information that may
            affect your order, we will contact you by e-mail as soon as possible and
            give you the opportunity to revise or cancel your order.
          </p>

          <h4>Pre Orders</h4>
          <p>
            When placing a pre order on our webshop, you will be charged once your
            order has been processed. Your order will be dispatched as soon as we
            receive the pre-ordered item from our supplier. We aim to keep the
            expected delivery time stated in the item description, but delays in
            production can occur.
          </p>

          <h4>Force Majeure</h4>
          <p>
            We are not responsible for delays or failure to meet our obligations in
            relation to the terms, if the delay or the non-compliance is due to events
            beyond our control.
          </p>

          <h4>The Completeness of Contract</h4>
          <p>
            These Terms & Conditions constitute the complete terms of the contract
            between us.
          </p>

          <h4>Invalidity</h4>
          <p>
            If one or more of the provisions in the Terms and Conditions are declared
            fully or partially invalid, the remaining provisions still apply.
          </p>

          <h4>Assignment</h4>
          <p>
            We are entitled to assign our rights and obligations under the contract
            with you to third parties. The standard of the services you receive will
            not be impaired by the assignment. We will notify you of such possible
            assignment. By accepting these conditions, you consent to any such future
            assignment. At the same time, you agree that from the time when we have
            given you notification of the assignment, your rights may be claimed only
            against the third party in question.
          </p>

          <h4>Right to Complain</h4>
          <p>
            In case you wish to complain about goods purchased from us, please contact
            us at <span class="email">returns@cover.international</span>.
          </p>

          <h4>Choice of Law & Jurisdiction</h4>
          <p>
            Any contracts concluded between us using these Terms and Conditions are
            governed by German law. Any dispute which may arise in connection with our
            contract, including its existence or validity, must be brought before a
            competent court in Germany. As a consumer you may bring proceedings
            against us in the courts for the place where you are domiciled.
