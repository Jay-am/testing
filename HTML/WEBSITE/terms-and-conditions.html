        <p>
          If you do not accept our Terms & Conditions, you cannot place an order

          “7. Return, Exchange & The Right of Withdrawal”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rules on lack of conformity in the German Sale of Goods Act apply
          to your purchase, which means you have certain warranties for the
          goods’ conformity. Read more under “8. Complains & Claims”.
        </p>

        <h3>3. PRICES</h3>
        <p>
          The prices on the website are shown in the currency applicable to your
          country. Please use the 'shipping to' function in the menu if you want
          to change your country selection.

        <h4>Outside EU orders:</h4>
        <p>
          Please note that the German 19% Sales Tax/VAT is not included in, or
          added to, orders sent to destinations outside the EU, but these orders
          may be subject to local taxes and/or import duties at your own
          expense. All fees regarding local customs, including handling, duties
          and taxes, will be sent to you directly from the courier.
        </p>
        <p>Prices do not include delivery charges.</p>
        <p>
          We do our very best to avoid information errors, but please note that
          pricing errors can occur. If this happens, you will be contacted by
          e-mail.
        </p>

        <h3>4. PAYMENT</h3>
        <ul>
          We accept the following means of payment:
        </ul>
        <li>PayPal</li>
        <li>ApplePay</li>
        <li>Visa</li>
        <li>Mastercard</li>

        <li>American Express</li>

        <p>
          For your online safety, we require that you enter your CVV security
          code when paying with credit card on our website. The security code is
          an anti-fraud security feature to help verify that you are in position
          of your credit card. On most credit cards you will find the
          three-digit security code on the back of the card, usually on the
          right side. If you pay with American Express, the four-digit security
          code is found on the front of the card on the right side.
        </p>
        <p>
          To maintain a high level of security when shopping with us, we have
          also implemented the PSD2 legislation (Revised Payment Service
          Directive) – a two-step verification method to avoid fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your goods leave our warehouse to be delivered, your payment will
          be debited on the selected payment service.
        </p>

        <h3>5. PLACING AN ORDER</h3>
        <p>
          Before submitting your order, please carefully revise your order-,
          payment-, delivery- and billing address information. Shortly after
          placing your order, you will receive an order confirmation by e-mail.
          Once you have submitted your order, it is not possible to cancel it.
          Please read “7. Return, Exchange & The Right of Withdrawal” for more
          information. If you made a mistake while placing your order, please
          contact <span class="email">help@cover.international</span> as soon as
          possible. In rare cases, an ordered item can be out of stock. If this
          happens, you will be contacted by e-mail to get the opportunity to
          revise or cancel your order.
        </p>

          processed on the following business day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among other things, we reserve the right to cancel your order, without
          being liable for compensation or other costs, if your payment details
          are incorrect or cannot be verified, if we have reason to believe that
          your order is placed with the purpose of committing fraud or if there
          is an inadvertent error on the website, such as a payment error or
          similar.
