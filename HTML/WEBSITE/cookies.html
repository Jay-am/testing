      <p>
        Today, cookies are used by almost all websites and are in many cases
        necessary to enhance and simplify a website visit – which is why we use
        them. On our website, we use cookies in accordance with the following
        cookie policy.

          <h3>1. WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
          <p>
            Cookies are small text files you receive from the websites you visit,
            stored on your computer, tablet, smartphone etc., allowing websites to
            recognize your IP address. Cookies may for instance be used to optimize
            website content based on statistics of the visitors’ use of the website. A
            cookie is a passive file and cannot collect information from the user’s
            computer or spread computer virus or other harmful programs. Some cookies
            are placed by websites (third parties) other than the one stated in the
            browser’s address line (the URL). The content of such cookies may be of a
            general nature, but they may also be, for example, analytical tools or
            embedded comment fields. This means that cookies are stored from parties
            other than the one owning the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some cookies are created temporarily and expire at the end of the user
            session when the browser is closed (session cookies). Other cookies are
            stored on the user’s IT equipment for a longer period of time (persistent
            cookie). When the user revisits a website, new session cookies will be
            placed in the temporary memory, whereas a persistent cookie will be
            renewed.
