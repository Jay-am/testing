<p>We cannot be held liable for any delays caused by the courier or local customs.</p>

<p>Prices do not include delivery charges.</p>




4. Outside EU orders:

Orders sent to a destination outside the EU may be subject to local taxes and/or import duties at your own expense. All fees regarding local customs, including handling, duties and taxes, will be sent to you directly from the courier.
