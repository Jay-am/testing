        <p>Furoshiki is existiong since 1600 - it's nothing we invented.</p>
        <p>why are you giving? because you love you want to connect</p>
        <p>there's just a better way to have a go at it with a huger impact.</p>
        <p>REUSE</p>
        <p>REDUCE</p>
        <p>RECYCLE</p>
        <p>but don't forget to</p>
        <p>RECOVER</p>
        <p>We have a zero waste policy. We won't touch new ressources.</p>
        <p>
          In order to deliver a low carbon circular economy, we are focusing on
          four areas: delivering a product with the lowest comparable carbon
          footprint, delivering highly effective equipment and solutions,
          minimising our operational impact, and working with partners to
          dramatically increase recycling and reuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we will use as little resources we need to produce this better way
          to handle gift wrapping
        </p>
        <p>
          We are measuring our CO2 Footprint and are trying to reduce it even
          more - every step on the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wont put any flyers in your parcel because we don't want to kill a
          tree just to send you marketing messages
        </p>
        <p>
          we won't place the bill inside your package for the same reason. You
          will get an electronic version you can use for whatever reson you need
          it. This was cousing us so many problems with the postal services
          because they wouldn't let us do it oversees.
        </p>
        <p>
          we're not using KARTONs to send the product to reduce even more paper
          waste because most of the times they are single use as well.
        </p>
        <p>We're sending the parcels green.</p>
        <p>
          We believe in innovation to create the best possible user-experience
          and support your wellbeing. We also value our customers’ input and
          include you in the process as much as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          VALUES WE STAND FOR 1. WE DO WHAT WE DO BECAUSE WE CARE 2. WE’RE
          DRIVEN BY PASSION & INNOVATION 3. WE DREAM BIG AND ACT BIG 4. WE
          ALWAYS PUSH BEYOND WHAT’S POSSIBLE 5. WE BELIEVE IN GIVING BACK. AND
