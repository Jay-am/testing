          Furoshiki is existiong since 1600 - it's nothing we invented and there
          are other companies selling eco-friendly versions.
        </p>
        <p>They are all doing there part on helping this planet to heel BUT</p>
        <p>why are you giving? because you love you want to connect</p>
        <p>there's just a better way to have a go at it with a huger impact.</p>
        <p>reuse</p>
        <p>reduce</p>
        <p>recycle</p>
        <p>We have a zero waste policy. We won't touch new ressources.</p>
        <p>
          And we will use as little resources we need to produce this better way
          to handle gift wrapping
        </p>
        <p>
          We are measuring our CO2 Footprint and are trying to reduce it even
          more - every step on the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wont put any flyers in your parcel because we don't want to kill a
          tree just to send you marketing messages
        </p>
        <p>
          we won't place the bill inside your package for the same reason. You
          will get an electronic version you can use for whatever reson you need
          it. This was cousing us so many problems with the postal services
          because they wouldn't let us do it oversees.
        </p>
        <p>
          we're not using KARTONs to send the product to reduce even more paper
          waste because most of the times they are single use as well.
        </p>
        <p>We're sending the parcels green.</p>
