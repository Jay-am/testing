          WHY
        </h1>
        <p class="paragraph-hero">
          In our comparativley short time on this planet we have used up a third of it's natural resources and are destroying species and habitats &ndash; even our own &ndash; in arlarming speed. Climate change and pollution are the direct result of our actions. If we're not changing the way we're living we won't be able to save this planet for future generations.

          Today, even the most environmentally progressive businesses and citizens are primarily focused on reducing the negative, and not necessarily aiming for a positive or even reversed ecological impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our vision is to move towards a future where humans are a net positive, regenerative force for our planet. This vision can become a reality as more individuals, businesses, and communities move away from a disposable culture towards one in which people are making holistic, thoughtful decisions. Decisions that are rooted in respect for the natural resources and a new way of thinking about how products are created, used, and where they end up after their life cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not meassuring the success of our company by the money we earn. We're meassuring our success by the achievemnts (saved and recovered trees, reduced trash and CO2, meaningful connections etc.) we make as a community.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>These achievments will be visible for everyone on our <a href="../../HTML/WEBSITE/coverage.html">coverage</a> page.</p> -->

          We are striving to be an ecologically ‘net positive’ company.
        </h2>
        <p class="purpose | purpose-1">
          We work towards a future in which our products, operations and supply chain are a positive, regenerative force for our planet. Where selling one of our products actually leads to carbon reduction and a stronger environment. We already pursue progressive strategies across all steps of our supply chain &mdash; sourcing, packaging, shipping, reverse logistics as well as disposal (see more on that on our <a href="" class="link">sustainability</a> page) and are very proud of our current product line, made of 100% recycled materials. But we know there is much more to do. Achieving our goal will require new ways of thinking about resources and production, incremental improvements in our operations, and major innovations in everything from delivery to waste management.
        </p>

        <h2 class="purpose__headline | purpose-2__headline">
          We aim to support everyone in adopting conscious, eco-minded practices so they can become a positive force for our planet and humanity.
        </h2>
        <p class="purpose | purpose-2">
          Our objective is to raise awareness on waste reduction and sustainable resources. We are calling to reduce single-use products (gift wrappings and packaging in gerneral) that are ending in landfills after just one use. We want to help everyone to wrap their presents and ship items in the most sustainable way to not just gift one person but help our planet and future generations to thrive and survive. We want to make sustainability convienent through #reducing, #reusing as well as #recycling and are helping to effortlessly #recover what we have destroyed so far.

          #REDUCE
        </h3>
        <p class="purpose | dark-green">
           We are reducing waste during production since we are processing recycled materials and thus are effectively reducing the need for new resources. By using our products you can avoid even more trash since they can be used over and over again.
        </p>

        <h3 class="purpose__heading | dark-green | brand">
          #REUSE
        </h3>
        <!-- <p class="dark-green">
          Reusing resources that have reached the end of their life cycle minimizes the need for new materials and lowers the amount that ends up in landfills.
        </p> -->
        <p class="purpose | dark-green">
          Next to reusing our <span class="brand">COVERS</span> over and over again we are also encouraging upcycling of products that have lost their shine or purpose and are presenting tips on how to do so in our <a href="" class="link">blog</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="purpose__heading | dark-green | brand">
          #RECYCLE
        </h3>
        <p class="purpose | dark-green">
           We are only using recycled materials to produce our <span class="brand">COVERS</span> and in case your <span class="brand">COVER</span> has reached the end of its life cycle it can be recycled again and again.
        </p>

        <h3 class="purpose__heading | red | brand">
          #RECOVER
        </h3>
        <p class="purpose | red">
          Since we also need to recover what we have destroyed so far we are planting a tree for every <span class="brand">COVER</span> bought to recover forests and fight agains climate change.
        </p>

        <h2 class="purpose__headline | purpose-3__headline">
          Ultimately, our goal is to make forward thinking, eco-friendly and conscious living the standard in our society.
        </h2>
        <p class="purpose | purpose-3">
          We aim to inspire everyone in their quest to make a positive impact on the planet and their communities and show easy and convenient ways on how to do so in daily real life situations. This way of life leads to more mindful, appreciative people and connected communities. A culture rooted in conscious decision making will give way to improved creation and usage of raw materials, to balanced carbon emissions, to enriched lands, habitats and oceans, to groundbreaking eco-minded innovations, and, ultimately, to a world where climate change and pollution has truly been reversed.
