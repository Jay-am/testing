            <p>Japanese have been packing personal belongings and gifts with Furoshiki since ancient times.</p>
            <p>Furoshiki are squares of fabric that can be used to wrap just about anything. While regular bags have a fixed amount of space and paper wrappings can only hardly be put around round or oddly shaped objects, a furoshiki is highly versatile and can be adapted to suit the exact needs of the specific objects to be wrapped. They look beautiful around a bottle of wine, boxes and even the most oddly shaped items. But best of all, they’re reusable, which makes them a gift to our earth as well.</p>

            <h2>THE ORIGIN OF FABRIC WRAPPING</h2>
            <p>Many people think fabric wrapping is unique to the Japanese culture, but it has in fact been a tradition in many countries including Korea where a patchwork wrapping cloth named Bojagi has been used for centuries.</p>
            <img src="#" alt="Bojagi">
            <p>If you want to know more about the Korean way to wrap presents, you can read our blog post about <a href="#" class="link">The Art of Bojagi</a>.</p>
            <p>While Japanese culture is not alone in using fabric wrapping, Furoshiki has a distinctive style reflecting their interest in ceremony, beauty, multi-functional objects and thoughtful detail in their approach to everyday living.</p>
            <p>Enter Furoshiki.</p>

            <h2>GIFT WRAPPING CULTURE IN JAPAN</h2>
            <p>In Japan the tradition of gift wrapping (tsutsumu) is as important as the present itself. The idea that giving someone an unwrapped item is considered extremely impolite. Even a tip given to a maid taking care of your room at a Japanese inn for example is wrapped in a small envelope. Wrapping gifts with Furoshiki implies respect towards the recipient and adds elegance and special meaning to the present.</p>
            <p>Since a lot of thought and time was put into selecting the perfect gift for that special someone, it deserves an equally thoughtful presentation.</p>

          <section class="blog-post__content | content-spacer" id="history">
            <h2>THE HISTORY OF FUROSHIKI 風呂敷<br>HOW IT STARTED IN JAPAN</h2>
            <p>The public bath has been part of Japanese culture for centuries. The custom of using Furoshiki dates back to the the Nara 奈良時代 period (710 to 794 AD). Baths in Japan then were usually only found in buddhist temples. While these baths were only used by priests initially, sick people were occasionally allowed access to the bathhouse. Back then Furoshiki were used to wrap sacred items of priests at shrines and temples. If narrowly defined as the traditional Japanese Furoshiki, it therefore dates back more than 1200 years but back then they weren't called Furoshiki yet. Until they have been known by that name a long time has passed and the name has changed a couple of times.</p>
            <p>In the latter half of the Heian 平安時代 period (794 to 1185 AD), the book of traditional criterion knowledge (Masasukeshouzokushou) was established and the expression Hiratsusumi (平裹 or 平包) which meant flat wrap was appearing. This expression is also being used in the copy of Ban Dainagon Emaki (The Tale of Great Minister Ban) in the latter half of the 12th century. Back then Furoshiki were used for the nobility to wrap and carry clothes and as a means for merchants to carry their goods.</p>
            <p>In the Jōhei 承平 period (931 to 938 AD), in the middle of the Heian era, The dictionary Wamyo Ruijusho was published and refers to the Furoshiki as Koromotsutumi (衣包) meaning cloth wrap.</p>
            <p>In the Kamakura 鎌倉時代 period (1185 to 1333 AD) wealthy merchants and members of the upper class soon also included baths in their residences but still no one was referring to them as Furoshiki.</p>
            <p>In the Muromachi 室町時代 period (1336 to 1573 AD) bathhouses were on the rise. One great steam bath was built by Shogun Ashikaga. The invited lords used silk cloth with their family crests printed in order to keep their clothes separate from others’ while taking a bath and to hold them after finishing their bath. Even at that point in time no one was referring to them as Furoshiki.</p>
            <p>The word Furoshiki only came about during the Edo 江戸時代 period (1603 to 1868 AD) when public bathhouses (Sentō 銭湯) became widespread and popular since urban culture flourished because of a stable social infrastructure. The bath which was expensive entertainment for only a few influential people came to reach the general public. People who didn’t have bathrooms in their house used to go to take a bath outside and wrapped everything they needed for the bath in a big, square cloth which they would spread out on the changing room floor to stand on while undressing and dressing. This is how the name Furoshiki arised. When you break the word Furoshiki into its parts, the first two letters furo (風呂) mean bath and the last one shiki (敷) means to spread out.</p>
            <img src="../../IMAGES/Furoshiki History.png" alt="Furoshiki History">
            <p>The oldest known use of the word dates back to 1616. In the Sunpuowakemonochou-odouguchou, the relic distribution book of Tokugawa Ieyasu it has been called “Kokura cotton furoshiki” but it is said that the name was changed from Hiratsutsumi to Furoshiki only around the 1700’s.</p>

          <section class="blog-post__content | content-spacer" id="the-rise">
            <h2>THE RISE OF THE FUROSHIKI</h2>
            <p>As entering the Meiji 明治 period (1868 to 1912 AD), the feudal system was over and 4 social classes got equality. Everyone could have family names and family crests, and the demand for Furoshiki with crests increased.</p>
            <p>Industrial development became a national policy, and due to the industrial revolution and technological innovations manufacturing changed from hand-weaving to machine weaving. The scale of the production system also expanded from wholesale based domestic manufacturing to factory based machine manufacturing, resulting in a drastic increase in productivity.</p>
            <p>Furoshiki grew in popularity and developed as an essential item at that time. People were starting to use Furoshiki to wrap almost everything like with today’s bags. Later, it even became popular to use Furoshiki as an elegant wrapping for gifts.</p>

          <section class="blog-post__content | content-spacer" id="the-fall">
            <h2>THE FALL OF THE FUROSHIKI</h2>
            <p>After the Second World War, with advances in production technology, the production volume increased further and as the lifestyle became more and more westernised it became common to use plastic bags. Supermarkets and department stores offered plastic bags free of charge and opportunities to use Furoshiki in everyday life steadily decreased.</p>

          <section class="blog-post__content | content-spacer" id="comeback">
            <h2>WHY THEY ARE COMING BACK</h2>
            <p>Due to the increasing ecological awareness in recent years Furoshiki had a comeback. To spread the resurgence in the artform even further the Japanese Minister of Environment Yuriko Koike created a Furoshiki named Mottainai Furoshiki in 2006 to promote its use.</p>

            <h2>TRADITIONAL SHAPE</h2>
            <p>A traditional Furoshiki cloth in ancient times was not perfectly square - the take (height) is slightly larger than the haba (width). This is because the cloth used to be cut from kimonos. They even had a string attached to them. Nowadays, most Furoshiki are square and strings are not part of the Furoshiki anymore.</p>

            <h2>WHAT SIZE SHOULD YOU USE?</h2>
            <p>A simple rule of thumb for wrapping a gift with a fabric wrap is to choose a cloth with a diagonal length 3 times the longest length of the object you will be wrapping. Or put into different words - the object you want to be wrapping should approximately be one-third of the Furoshiki's diagonal line.</p>
            <img src="#" alt="Furoshiki's diagonal line">
            <p>Keep in mind that Furoshiki embraces a creative and fluid process and that there are no set rules to follow. Usually, a little more room to wrap with is better than not having enough room.</p>

            <h2>HOW TO WRAP | BIND | TIE A FUROSHIKI</h2>
            <p>There are hundreds of ways Furoshiki can be tied. Your wrapping can be tailored to the specific shape of the object being wrapped without destroying the looks and the best thing is that you don’t even need a table, scissors, sticky tape or ribbons to hold it together or make it look beautiful and this is why it's even quicker than paper wrapping.</p>
            <img src="#" alt="Folding a Furoshiki">
            <p>We have put together several video tutorials on how to wrap with a fabric cloth. From the most easy way to more advanced styles. You can watch these tutorials in our <a href="#" class="link">blog</a>.</p>
            <p>Just a quick comment on how Japanese are going on with their wrapping before you are starting. It’s been said that Japanese first still their mind then focus on the person the gift is intended for while picking, folding and tying the fabric and even the gift itself. Naturally they may find themselves slipping into a meditative state.</p>

            <h2>EDGING AND CORNERS</h2>
            <p>While wrapping, pay attention to the corners because these will be a key feature of your Furoshiki once you fold and tie your creation.</p>

            <p>The edges of our COVERs are red to make them look even more special and to distinguish them from other products. Furthermore the corners are rounded to make the folded result look even more beautiful. This way you will always be able to tell them apart from other fabric wraps.</p>

            <h2>HOW TO GIVE</h2>
            <p>In ancient times the giver was presenting the gift to the receiver, unveiled it then kept the cloth for the next use. In more recent times the wrapping has been part of the gift to not only spread the Furoshiki but also the message.</p>
            <p>Since fabric wrapping isn’t that common in western countries yet it can be helpful to give the presentee a quick demonstration on how simple it is to wrap a gift with a fabric wrap. This ensures your Furoshiki has a high chance of being passed on and spreading the eco-friendly fabric wrapping message on its journey.</p>

            <p>The oldest still existing Furoshiki is in the safekeeping at the Shōsō-in (正倉院) - the treasure house that belongs to Tōdai-ji temple in Nara, Japan and remained in a good preserved state until today. It was made around the 8th century and was intended to cover special things such as monk’s kesa (kasaya) and attire of bugaku (dancing and music). The Furoshiki at that time was distinctive with a string, which Furoshiki today are missing.</p>
            <p>The Shōsō-in Imperial treasures persist of the letters ka (裹) and kou (幌) both meaning wrap.</p>

            <h2>EXPRESSIONS AROUND WRAPPING</h2>
            <p>Oo-buroshiki (tall tale) literally means a large furoshiki.</p>
            <p>Before the name Furoshiki was widely spread the tradition of gift wrapping was known as tsutsumu (wrap). The word tsutsushimu (which means suppressing one’s feelings) partly characterizes Japanese people’s behavior. Suppressing one's feelings is considered more important than speaking out candidly. It is tantamount to wrapping one’s feelings and suggests it’s close relation to the Japanese wrapping culture.</p>
