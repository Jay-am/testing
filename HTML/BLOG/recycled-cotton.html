        <p>Choosing fabrics based on our values is one of the first things we can do to make our lifestyle more eco-friendly and sustainable.</p>
        <p>When we started our journey we knew that we wanted to create the most sustainable product possible with the lowest or highest impact on the planet &mdash; from whatever perspective you want to look at it. Organic products and GOTS certification was definitely in our heads right from the start but we wanted to do even better. We want to live and breath zero waste. Since new resources need to be touched &mdash; even for the production of organic fabrics &mdash; this wasn’t our solution.</p>
        <!-- <p> This is why we wanted to use what is already given and try to transform existing resources (waste) into beautiful products that will save our planet. </p> -->
        <p>It was clear that we wanted to use recycled fabrics but we weren’t sure which one to pick since there are so many fabrics to choose from. We were asking ourselves if natural always equals good and synthetic equals bad? And there’s truly a lot of debate about which fabrics are sincerely sustainable. Especially when you're not only looking at the fabric itself but also the production, the usage and the life span of the item. Will it be washed often? What happens when we wash it or even dispose of it?</p>
        <p class="last">We found some amazing research on this topic. One article in particular. good on you are going through the different materials and are picking their favorite. And so did we.</p>

          <h2>COTTON</h2>  
          <p class="space">Cotton is one of the most common and most used fabrics. This natural fibre is light and breathable which makes it a wardrobe staple. But growing cotton can be problematic: conventional cotton is one of the thirstiest and most chemical-intensive crops to grow. It requires a lot of pesticides and, as a result, has a negative impact on the planet, and the people who grow it.</p>
          <h2 class="organic-cotton">ORGANIC COTTON</h2>
          <p class="space">Organic cotton, a more sustainable alternative to conventional cotton, has been booming in the last few years. It aims to minimise the environmental impact of cotton production by trying to remove harmful pesticides and other chemicals from the production process but to ensure high standards in production the organic cotton has to be <a href="https://www.global-standard.org/" class="link" target="_blank">GOTS-certified</a>.</p>
          <h2 class="recycled-cotton">RECYCLED COTTON</h2>
          <p>If you’re looking for the most sustainable cotton, however, go recycled. Recycled or upcycled cotton is made using post-industrial and post-consumer cotton waste. According to the <a href="https://apparelcoalition.org/higg-product-tools/" class="link" target="_blank">Higg Materials Sustainability Index</a>, recycled cotton is a more sustainable alternative to both conventional and organic cotton.<br><br><span class="ultra-strong">It has the potential to help reduce water and energy consumption, as well as help keep cotton clothes out of landfill &mdash; which is why good on you considers it one of the most sustainable fibres on the market.</span></p>

      <section class="conclusion | recycled-cotton__content">
        <div class="recycled-cotton__copy | content-spacer">
          <p>After our research we came to the conclusion that &mdash; at least at this moment of time &mdash; recycled cotton is our way to go. We know that everything is constantly evolving and as more research and data comes to light maybe even better solutions will occur. We will always try to be at the ravages of time &mdash; or even ahead of it &mdash; and of course, fabrics are not the only thing to address.</p>
          <p>As a brand we need to take the whole production cycle and life span of the product into account &mdash; also addressing greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain, textile waste or labour rights issues. This is far from best practice in the industry, but we want to show that it is possible. For us using the most sustainable fabrics was just a good base to start with and from there we are constantly taking a very close look at every stage in the process to improve wherever possible.</p>
