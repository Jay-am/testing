        <h1>CONSCIOUS CHOICES</h1>
        <p>xx that make you feel good, look good, do good.</p>
        <p>
          If you too are frustrated thinking about plastic waste but feel
          powerless in front of such a massive task, you’re not alone. Yes,
          enough plastic is thrown away each year to circle the Earth four times
          and way too little is recycled and it takes about 450 years to
          decompose a single-use plastic.

        </p>
        DON’T THINK YOU’RE TOO SMALL TO CREATE A REAL CHANGE. You are an active

        <p>
          We care about sustainability Since day one, we’re operating our
          business in an environmentally friendly way. From choosing sustainable
          materials for our bottles to reducing our carbon footprint by bringing
          our production partners closer and having each bottle handled in our
          HQ. We believe in leading by example and we hope to inspire other
          companies!

        <p>plastik waste</p>
        <p>
          Here's how we're making an impact: PRODUCTION: We only choose
          premium-quality, planet-friendly materials to design our products.
          EDUCATION: A big part of our marketing focuses on educating our
          audience about sustainable living. PARTNERSHIPS: Partnerships with
          social media influencers and major players play an important role in
          raising awareness about sustainability. ACTIVE CLEANUP PLAYER: We also
          regularly take part in cleanup actions and we love it!
        </p>
        <p>
          STANDING FOR THE CAUSE. We put a lot of effort in trying to bring your
          attention to what we feel is a really important cause and that your
          actions count, no matter how little the change might feel. Whether it
          is on social media, on the web or in your local newspaper we our
          shouting loud, standing next to you in every climate strike and
          fighting for (long due) necessary changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          GIVING BACK If it’s not us organising an important event on the topics
          that matter to all of us, and our values align with the cause of
          others, we love to show our support by sponsorships. We are a regular
          active participant in the World Clean Up movement and in the Plastic
          free July initiative. With 85% of our clients being women and more
          than 50% of our team being women as well, a very dear cause to us is
          the Europa Donna organisation advocating for breast cancer prevention.
